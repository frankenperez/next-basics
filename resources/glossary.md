**Client Side Rendering** (CSR) [Client Side Rendering in Key Concepts](../00-concepts/README.md#client-side-rendering-csr-and-single-page-applications-spa).

**First Contentful Paint** (FCP). It is a user-centric metric for measuring perceived page load speed and refers to the time it takes for the browser to render the first bit of content in the DOM since the content was requested, providing the first feedback to the user that the page is actually loading.

**JAMstack**. Previously stylized as _JAMStack_ (stands for Javascript, API and Markup), is an architecture designed to make the web faster, more secure, and easier to scale. The core principles of pre-rendering, a nd decoupling, enable sites and applications to be delivered with greater confidence and resilience than ever before. It has revolutionized the way we think about building for the web by providing a simpler developer experience, better performance, lower cost and greater scalability.

**Largest Contentful Paint** (LCP). It is a user-centric metric for measuring perceived load speed and refers to the time it takes for the browser to get the largest/main element on the page visible. [Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/lcp/)

**Static Site Generation** (SSG). Process of compiling and rendering a website or app at build time. [Static Site Generation in Key Concepts](../00-concepts/README.md#static-site-generation).

**Server Side Rendering** (SSR). Process of compiling and rendering HTML files during runtime on the server in response to a user request. [Server Side Rendering in Key Concepts](../00-concepts/README.md#server-side-rendering-ssr).

**Time To First Byte** (TTFB) . It is a metric for determining the responsiveness of a web server and measures the amount of time between the browser requesting a page from the server and the download of the first content on the page.
